At The Nile our biggest concern is our consumers, and our biggest cost is delivering their goods to them. We want to develop a program that will help us minimize these costs so we can continue making everyone happy

At The Nile, we have a joke. Without our fantastic drivers, who fulfill orders every day, weâ€™d just be sitting with millions of toys, electronics, and clothing in warehouses to ourselves.

Our team is important, and we want to make sure the hardest workers find their home in our careers. In order to do that, we need to figure out who the best person is for each job.

In order to find the best person, we need to calculate how much it would cost for any of the drivers to fulfill this order.
